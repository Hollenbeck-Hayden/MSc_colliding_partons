#: name: Table 1
#: description: Combined transverse momentum spectra of PI, K and P, sum of particles and antiparticles, measured at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at SQRT(S) = 7 TeV normalized to the number of inelastic collisions. Statistical and systematic uncertainties are reported. The uncertainty due to the normalization to inelastic collisions (+7-4 %) is not included.
