#: name: Figure 1a
#: description: Cross sections for inclusive $\pi^0$ production in p + p and d + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV, compared to a NLO pQCD calculations [8] based on the DDS set of fragmentation functions [24], and to the STAR $\pi^{+-}$ measurement [25]. Normalization uncertainty of 11.7% is not included.
