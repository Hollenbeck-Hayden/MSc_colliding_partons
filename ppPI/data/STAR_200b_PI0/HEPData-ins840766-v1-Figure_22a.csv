#: description: Cross sections for inclusive $\pi^0$ production in p + p and d + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The solid lines correspond to NLO pQCD calculations. The measured $\pi^0$ cross sections were not corrected for feed-down contributions $\eta$ -> 3$\pi^0$, $\eta$ -> $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$, and $K_S^0$ -> $\pi^0\pi^0$, which were expected to be negligible. Normalization uncertainties of 11.7% for p+p and 5.3% for d+Au are not shown.
