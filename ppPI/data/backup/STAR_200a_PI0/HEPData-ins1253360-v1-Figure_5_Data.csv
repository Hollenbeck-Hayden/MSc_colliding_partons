#: name: Figure 5 Data
#: description: Upper panel, the $\pi^{0}$ cross section (blue markers) is shown compared with an NLO pQCD cal- culation with three options for the scale parameter. The lower panel presents the ratio of the data to the pT-scale theory curve, as well as the ratio of the 2pT-scale and pT/2-scale theory curves to the pT-scale curve.
